## ‚öôÔ∏è How to Use

The Bank Loan Report Analysis project can be explored in **two main steps**:

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Prepare Data in MySQL
1. Create a database and import the CSV dataset.  
2. Run the SQL scripts in `SQL_File/` to clean and calculate key metrics:  
   - `Data_clean.sql` ‚Üí clean data  
   - `Bank_Loan_Report Summary.sql` ‚Üí summary KPIs  
   - `Bank_Loan_Report Overviews.sql` ‚Üí overview metrics  

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Explore Dashboards in Power BI
1. Open `Bank_Loan.pbix` in Power BI Desktop.  
2. Connect to your MySQL database and load the cleaned tables.  
3. Navigate the dashboards:
   - **Summary Dashboard:** High-level KPIs and Good vs Bad Loans.  
   - **Overview Dashboard:** Trend and regional charts; use the **Select Measure** slicer to switch between Total Applications, Total Funded Amount, and Total Amount Received.  
   - **Details Dashboard:** Granular loan and borrower analysis; use filters to drill down.  

4. **Use Slicers to Filter Data Dynamically:**  
   - **Good vs Bad Loan** ‚Äì view only performing or underperforming loans.  
   - **Grade** ‚Äì analyze loans by borrower credit grade.  
   - **State** ‚Äì filter loans for a specific region.

## üìã Project Summary

The **Bank Loan Report Analysis** project provides a comprehensive view of a bank's lending portfolio using **MySQL** for data processing and **Power BI** for visualization.  

It helps analyze loan applications, funded amounts, repayments, and borrower profiles to support **data-driven decision-making**.  

**Key Highlights:**
- Monitor **Total Loan Applications, Funded Amounts, and Amounts Received** with Month-to-Date (MTD) and Month-over-Month (MoM) trends.  
- Evaluate **borrower financial health** using Average Debt-to-Income (DTI) ratio and Average Interest Rate.  
- Analyze **Good vs Bad Loans** to identify performance and risk areas.  
- Interactive **dashboards** with filters and slicers for Good vs Bad Loan, Grade, and State.  
- Overview dashboard with **6 dynamic charts** (Line, Bar, Donut, Filled Map, Tree Map) to visualize trends, distributions, and regional patterns.  
- Details dashboard for granular analysis of loans and borrower data.  

This project demonstrates **SQL data preparation, data cleaning, DAX measures, Power BI modeling, and interactive dashboard creation**, making it suitable for a **Data Analyst portfolio**.
